###What is Github

Github is an online website where programmers can share and store their code. Here, you can see previous revisions and variations of a project.

These three features - fork, pull request and merge - are what make Github so powerful. In this website we will explain
how these features work as well as how to use them.

But first we will start with making an account.
To do this simply follow the instructions below:

  * Go to [github.com](github.com)
  * Hit Sign Up
  * Follow the instructions
  * Make the username with the same guidlines as Slack (first name, last name)

Lets start with creating a Repository, but what is a Github Repository? Well, repositorys are a place in github where
things are or may be stored.  

###Creating a Repository

  * Click the + button on the top left
  * Hit New Repository
  * Follow the instructions

Now, that you have your own repository, lets look at somebody else's repository. You can do this by simply searching a
random persons github repository or you may look at this repository right [HERE](araiyan.github.io/Own-Website)
//keep working from here

### Create an Initial Commit

  * Navigate to the file you want to add to Github
